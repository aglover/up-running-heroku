# Up and Running with Heroku


[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) recently announced that 50% of all incoming web requests to their platform originate from a mobile app. And while Heroku will not publicly announce the number of applications hosted on their platform, without a doubt there are hundreds of thousands. 

Clearly, Heroku is hub for mobile backends and anyone who's familiar with the platform isn't surprised. Application deployment on Heroku couldn't be easier; moreover, while its roots are firmly established in the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) community, Heroku supports a plethora of other language platforms like [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Java](http://www.java.com/en/), [Python](http://www.python.org/), and more. 

In this hands-on workshop, I'll show you how to get started with Heroku and I'll teach you everything you need to know for managing, monitoring, and supporting your Heroku app. You'll leave this session with a firm grasp of [Git](http://git-scm.com/), the Heroku platform, [Heroku's add-ons](https://addons.heroku.com/), and I'll go over some alternative options. 


## Let's get started! 

This workshop is organized into 3 labs. We don't have a lot of time, so I strongly suggest you pair with someone. People with OSX, please volunteer to be pairing partners as it'll reduce friction because I'm also on OSX. That is, if you have Windows or Linux and someone near you is on a MacBook, then you should probably ask to pair with that person as my directions are tailored to OSX. 

Keep in mind, at least one person will need access to email as creating an account in Heroku uses a two phased authorization for account creation. That is, you'll need to click on a link in an email Heroku sends to you.
